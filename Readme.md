## üìä Project Overview

The project involves analyzing three database tables containing Instagram activity data. the goal is to explore this data, answer key questions, and create actionable insights.
This analysis explores:

1. How many unique post types are found in the 'fact_content' table?
2. What are the highest and lowest recorded impressions for each post type?
3. Filter all the posts that were published on a weekend in the month of March and April and export them to a separate csv file.
4. Create a report to get the statistics for the account. The final output includes the following fields:
‚Ä¢ month_name
‚Ä¢ total_profile_visits
‚Ä¢ total_new_followers
5. Write a CTE that calculates the total number of 'likes‚Äô for each 'post_category' during the month of 'July' and subsequently, arrange the 'post_category' values in     descending order according to their total likes.
6. Create a report that displays the unique post_category names alongside their respective counts for each month. The output should have three columns:
‚Ä¢month_name
‚Ä¢post_category_names
‚Ä¢post_category_count
Example:
‚Ä¢April', 'Earphone,Laptop,Mobile,Other Gadgets,Smartwatch', '5'
‚Ä¢'February', 'Earphone,Laptop,Mobile,Smartwatch', '4'
 
7.What is the percentage breakdown of total reach by post type? The final output includes the following fields:
‚Ä¢post_type
‚Ä¢total_reach
‚Ä¢reach_percentage
8.Create a report that includes the quarter, total comments, and total saves recorded for each post category. Assign the following quarter groupings:
(January, February, March) ‚Üí ‚ÄúQ1‚Äù
(April, May, June) ‚Üí ‚ÄúQ2‚Äù
(July, August, September) ‚Üí ‚ÄúQ3‚Äù
The final output columns should consist of:
‚Ä¢post_category
‚Ä¢quarter
‚Ä¢total_comments
‚Ä¢total_saves
9.List the top three dates in each month with the highest number of new followers. The final output should include the following columns:
‚Ä¢month
‚Ä¢date
‚Ä¢new_followers
10.Create a stored procedure that takes the 'Week_no' as input and generates a report displaying the total shares for each 'Post_type'. The output of the procedure should consist of two columns:
‚Ä¢post_type
‚Ä¢total_shares
